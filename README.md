# Appetize - Webtech 2 final project

### What is Appetize
Appetize is a food review web application that enables you to search for restaurants based on location, sort by “buzz” (most talked about) and review your favourite restaurant.

### AJAX Techniques Implemented
- Multistage downloading 
- Submission Throttling   
- Predictive fetch
- Periodic Refresh
- XMLHttpRequest

 ### External Libraries Used
- React
- Reactstrap
- Bootstrap
- Material UI
- MongoDB
- Shiny package with R
 
### ML/AI Component
- Food Image Recognition
- A small photo icon on the bottom left of the homepage takes you to a site wherein, if you do not know the name of a food item, we harness a Machine Learning algorithm to allow the user to find out the food item automatically
- Technologies used: Keras, Shiny with R

 ### THE BUZZ
- Find out what the trending places are right now
- This page presents a collection of the top nine restaurants at the moment, and is ranked based on the number of comments for that page
- Buzz refers to the amount of people talking about a particular restaurant, hence we use the number of comments as a measure
- Predictive fetch has been used while scrolling to act as a performance improvement
